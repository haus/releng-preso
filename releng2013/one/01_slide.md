# Where we were #
## (One year ago, circa Q1 2012) ##

* Disparate tasks between projects
* Different release workflows between projects
* No easy path for devs to get packages

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Disparate Tasks #

* Is it `rake puppetpackage`?
* Or `rake package`?
* Or `rake package:tar`?
* Or `rake pkg:tar`?

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Different Workflows #

* Did the tar task already generate the specfile?
* Did it do it right? Do I need to hand edit it?
* Does the packaging live in a different repo entirely (it did)?
* Does the packaging live in $PROJ/ext? or in $PROJ/conf

## Occasionally devs like using real packages ##
# That's awesome! But how do they get them? #
* From us
* That must be a lot of manual work
* What if they know how to build them?
* That must be a lot of manual work
